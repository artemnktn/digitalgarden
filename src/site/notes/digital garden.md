A digital garden is a place to build &Â Learn In Public. The goal is to reduce the friction taken to publish a note, so that as I learn, you can learn with me.

- ðŸŒ±Â _Seedlings_Â for very rough and early ideas
- ðŸŒ¿Â _Budding_Â for work I've cleaned up and clarified
- ðŸŒ³Â _Evergreen_Â for work that is reasonably complete (though I still tend these over time).

The notes are meant to be interconnected with one another, so you, as the reader, can follow along a train of thought and gather insights about... whatever it is i'm writing about.
